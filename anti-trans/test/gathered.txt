SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``Equality Act''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:(1) Discrimination can occur on the basis of the sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition of an individual, as well as because of sex-based stereotypes. Each of these factors alone can serve as the basis for discrimination, and each is a form of sex discrimination.(2) A single instance of discrimination may have more than one basis. For example, discrimination against a married same-sex couple could be based on the sex stereotype that marriage should only be between heterosexual couples, the sexual orientation of the two individuals in the couple, or both. In addition, some persons are subjected to discrimination based on a combination or the intersection of multiple protected characteristics. Discrimination against a pregnant lesbian could be based on her sex, her sexual orientation, her pregnancy, or on the basis of multiple factors.(3) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (referred to as ``LGBTQ'') people commonly experience discrimination in securing access to public accommodations--including restaurants, senior centers, stores, places of or establishments that provide entertainment, health care facilities, shelters, government offices, youth service providers including adoption and foster care providers, and transportation. Forms of discrimination include the exclusion and denial of entry, unequal or unfair treatment, harassment, and violence. This discrimination prevents the full participation of LGBTQ people in society and disrupts the free flow of commerce.(4) Women also have faced discrimination in many establishments such as stores and restaurants, and places or establishments that provide other goods or services, such as entertainment or transportation, including sexual harassment, differential pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding.(5) Many employers already and continue to take proactive steps, beyond those required by some States and localities, to ensure they are fostering positive and respectful cultures for all employees. Many places of public accommodation also recognize the economic imperative to offer goods and services to as many consumers as possible.(6) Regular and ongoing discrimination against LGBTQ people, as well as women, in accessing public accommodations contributes to negative social and economic outcomes, and in the case of public accommodations operated by State and local governments, abridges individuals' constitutional rights.(7) The discredited practice known as ``conversion therapy'' is a form of discrimination that harms LGBTQ people by undermining individuals' sense of self worth, increasing suicide ideation and substance abuse, exacerbating family conflict, and contributing to second-class status.(8) Both LGBTQ people and women face widespread discrimination in employment and various services, including by entities that receive Federal financial assistance. Such discrimination--(A) is particularly troubling and inappropriate for programs and services funded wholly or in part by the Federal Government;(B) undermines national progress toward equal treatment regardless of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity; and(C) is inconsistent with the constitutional principle of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.(9) Federal courts have widely recognized that, in enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress validly invoked its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to provide a full range of remedies in response to persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination by both private and government actors.(10) Discrimination by State and local governments on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In many circumstances, such discrimination also violates other constitutional rights such as those of liberty and privacy under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.(11) Individuals who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have been subjected to a history and pattern of persistent, widespread, and pervasive discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity by both private sector and Federal, State, and local government actors, including in employment, housing, and public accommodations, and in programs and activities receiving Federal financial assistance. This discrimination inflicts a range of tangible and intangible harms, sometimes even including serious physical injury or death. An explicit and comprehensive national solution is needed to address this discrimination, including the full range of remedies available under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.(12) Discrimination based on sexual orientation includes discrimination based on an individual's actual or perceived romantic, emotional, physical, or sexual attraction to other persons, or lack thereof, on the basis of gender. LGBTQ people, including gender nonbinary people, also commonly experience discrimination because of sex-based stereotypes. Many people are subjected to discrimination because of others' perceptions or beliefs regarding their sexual orientation. Even if these perceptions are incorrect, the identity imputed by others forms the basis of discrimination.(13) Numerous provisions of Federal law expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, and Federal courts and agencies have correctly interpreted these prohibitions on sex discrimination to include discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex stereotypes. In particular, the Supreme Court of the United States correctly held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020) that the prohibition on employment discrimination because of sex under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 inherently includes discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.(14) This Act makes explicit that existing Federal statutes prohibiting sex discrimination in employment (including in access to benefits), healthcare, housing, education, credit, and jury service also prohibit sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination.(15) LGBTQ people often face discrimination when seeking to rent or purchase housing, as well as in every other aspect of obtaining and maintaining housing. LGBTQ people in same-sex relationships are often discriminated against when two names associated with one gender appear on a housing application, and transgender people often encounter discrimination when credit checks or inquiries reveal a former name.(16) National surveys, including a study commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, show that housing discrimination against LGBTQ people is very prevalent. For instance, when same-sex couples inquire about housing that is available for rent, they are less likely to receive positive responses from landlords. A national matched-pair testing investigation found that nearly one-half of same-sex couples had encountered adverse, differential treatment when seeking elder housing. According to other studies, transgender people have half the homeownership rate of non-transgender people and about 1 in 5 transgender people experience homelessness. Another survey found that 82 percent of gender nonbinary people experiencing homelessness lacked access to shelter.(17) As a result of the absence of explicit prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, credit applicants who are LGBTQ, or are perceived to be LGBTQ, have unequal opportunities to establish credit. LGBTQ people can experience being denied a mortgage, credit card, student loan, or many other types of credit simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.(18) Numerous studies demonstrate that LGBTQ people, especially transgender people and women, are economically disadvantaged and at a higher risk for poverty compared with other groups of people. For example, the poverty rate for older women in same-sex couples is twice that of older different-sex couples.(19) The right to an impartial jury of one's peers and the reciprocal right to jury service are fundamental to the free and democratic system of justice in the United States and are based in the Bill of Rights. There is, however, an unfortunate and long-documented history in the United States of attorneys discriminating against LGBTQ individuals, or those perceived to be LGBTQ, in jury selection. Failure to bar peremptory challenges based on the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of an individual not only erodes a fundamental right, duty, and obligation of being a citizen of the United States, but also unfairly creates a second class of citizenship for LGBTQ victims, witnesses, plaintiffs, and defendants.(20) Numerous studies document the shortage of qualified and available homes for the approximately 424,000 youth in the child welfare system and the negative outcomes for the many youth who live in group care as opposed to a loving home or who age out of care without a permanent family placement. Although same-sex couples are 7 times more likely to foster or adopt than their different-sex counterparts, many child-placing agencies refuse to serve same-sex couples and LGBTQ individuals. This has resulted in a reduction of the pool of qualified and available homes for youth in the child welfare system who need placement on a temporary or permanent basis. It also sends a negative message about LGBTQ people to children and youth in the child welfare system about who is, and who is not, considered fit to be a parent. While the priority should be on providing the supports necessary to keep children with their families, when removal is required, barring discrimination in foster care and adoption will increase the number of homes available to foster children waiting for foster and adoptive families.(21) LGBTQ youth are overrepresented in the foster care system by at least a factor of two and report twice the rate of poor treatment while in care compared to their non-LGBTQ counterparts. LGBTQ youth in foster care have a higher average number of placements, higher likelihood of living in a group home, and higher rates of hospitalization for emotional reasons and of juvenile justice involvement than their non-LGBTQ peers because of the high level of bias and discrimination that they face and the difficulty of finding affirming foster placements. Further, due to their physical distance from friends and family, traumatic experiences, and potentially unstable living situations, all youth involved with child welfare services are at risk for being targeted by traffickers seeking to exploit children. Barring discrimination in child welfare services will ensure improved treatment and outcomes for LGBTQ foster children.(22) Courts consistently have found that the government has a compelling interest in preventing and remedying discrimination. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States found there to be a compelling government interest in eliminating sex discrimination in Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987). Because discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity inherently is a form of sex discrimination, as held in Bostock v. Clayton County, 140 S. Ct. 1731 (2020), this Act furthers the compelling government interest in providing redress for the serious harms to mental and physical health, financial security and wellbeing, civic participation, freedom of movement and opportunity, personal dignity, and physical safety that result from discrimination. Consistent with the role nondiscrimination laws play in protecting lives and livelihoods, alleviating suffering, and improving individual and public health, the Supreme Court of the United States has long recognized, under the decision in Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241 (1964), that these laws also benefit society as a whole by ending the ``disruptive effect'' discrimination has on travel and commerce, and by creating a level field for all participants in a given sector.(23) As with all prohibitions on invidious discrimination, this Act furthers the government's compelling interest in the least restrictive way because only by forbidding discrimination is it possible to avert or redress the harms described in this subsection.(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to expand as well as clarify, confirm and create greater consistency in the protections and remedies against discrimination on the basis of all covered characteristics and to provide guidance and notice to individuals, organizations, corporations, and agencies regarding their obligations under the law.SEC. 3.

R. 8170 To require elementary schools and secondary schools that receive Federal funds to obtain parental consent before facilitating a child'sgender transition in any form, and for other purposes.IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 22, 2022Mr. Banks (for himself, Mr. LaMalfa, Mr. Good of Virginia, Mr. Norman, Mrs. Harshbarger, Mr. Mann, Mr. Babin, and Mr. Grothman) introduced thefollowing bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education andLabor A BILLTo require elementary schools and secondary schools that receive Federal funds to obtain parental consent before facilitating a child'sgender transition in any form, and for other purposes.Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.This Act may be cited as the ``Empower Parents to Protect Their Kids Act of 2022''.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress finds the following:(1) School districts across the country are violating parental and familial rights by encouraging or instructing staff to deceive or withhold information from parents if their child expresses confusion about their gender and is seeking to ``transition''. Without parental knowledge or consent, schools are facilitating ``social gender transitions'' by changing the names and pronouns of children in school, or even allowing children to change which sex-segregated facilities they use, such as rest rooms, locker rooms, and dormitories or other housing for overnight field trips.(2) Powerful teachers unions and activist organizations are pressuring more schools to adopt policies to enable and encourage children, of any age, to change their ``gender identity'' at school without parental notice or consent.(3) Contrary to the unfounded assertions of activists, ``socially transitioning'' a child is not an evidence-based practice and it is not a neutral or uncontroversial decision. This practice is an experimental social and psychological intervention that has immediate effects on a child's psychology and a high likelihood of changing the life path of a child. A ``social gender transition'' may make it more difficult for a child to reverse course later on, thereby increasing the likelihood that the child will continue on to a ``medical transition'', resulting in life-changing, irreversible consequences.(4) Any policies that attempt to circumvent parental authority are a violation of parents' constitutionally protected rights to direct the care, custody, and upbringing of their children as recognized by the Supreme Court. Further, policies that withhold information from parents or ask children about intimate details of their family life violate Federal statutes designed to uphold a parent's rights and duties in education. School districts implementing such policies are misrepresenting or entirely ignoring these statutes and constitutional protections.(5) Schools should never be allowed to intrude on family life by misleading or excluding parents and confusing children.SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT OF PARENTAL CONSENT.(a) In General.--No Federal funds shall be made available to any elementary school or secondary school unless the elementary school or secondary school, with respect to students enrolled at the school who have not yet reached 18 years of age, complies with each of the following requirements:(1) School employees do not proceed with any accommodation intended to affirm a student's purported ``gender identity'', where the student's purported ``gender identity'' is incongruous with the student's biological sex, or any action to facilitate a ``gender transition'', including referral or recommendation to any third-party medical provider, unless the employees have received express parental consent to do so.(2) School employees do not facilitate, encourage, or coerce students to withhold information from their parents regarding the student's ``gender transition'' or the student's purported ``gender identity'', where the student's purported ``gender identity'' is incongruous with the student's biological sex.(3) School employees do not withhold or hide information from parents about a student's desired ``gender transition'' or a student's purported ``gender identity'', where the student's purported ``gender identity'' is incongruous with the student's biological sex.(4) School employees do not encourage, pressure, or coerce the parents of students, or students themselves, to proceed with any treatment or intervention to affirm the student's purported ``gender identity'', where that ``gender identity'' is incongruous with the student's biological sex.(b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed--(1) to prevent a school employee from contacting appropriate legal authorities about an imminent threat to a student's physical safety in the event that the school employee knows or has a reasonable suspicion that the student is at risk of physical abuse, as defined in section 1169 of title 18, United States Code; or(2) to deprive any parent of the right to be involved in a child's actions or discussions about gender transition, without the due process of law.(c) Ensuring Compliance.--The head of each Federal agency shall require each application for Federal assistance submitted by a State educational agency or local educational agency to the head of such Federal agency--(1) to describe the steps that each elementary school and secondary school served by the State educational agency or local educational agency proposes to take to ensure compliance with the requirements under this section and how these steps preserve and protect the authority of the family; and(2) to ensure that--(A) a copy of the written policy that each elementary school and secondary school served by the State educational agency or local educational agency has to ensure compliance with the requirements under this section is provided to the head of such Federal agency and to the families of enrolled students; and(B) each such policy is clearly and publicly posted on the website of the school.(d) Civil Action for Certain Violations.--(1) In general.--A qualified party may, in a civil action, obtain appropriate relief with regard to a designated violation.(2) Administrative remedies not required.--An action under this section may be commenced, and relief may be granted, without regard to whether the party commencing the action has sought or exhausted any available administrative remedy.(3) Defendants in actions under this section may include governmental entities as well as others.--An action under this section may be brought against any elementary school or secondary school receiving Federal financial assistance or any governmental entity assisting an elementary school or secondary school.(4) Nature of relief.--In an action under this section, the court shall grant--(A) all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and declaratory relief;(B) to a prevailing plaintiff, reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation costs; and(C) payment for treatments or therapy needed to repair harm to the child perpetuated by pursuit of ``gender transition'' determined necessary by the parent and the child's medical providers.(5) Attorneys fees for defendant.--If a defendant in a civil action under this subsection prevails and the court finds that the plaintiff's suit was frivolous, the court shall award a reasonable attorney's fee in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff.(e) Definitions.--In this section:(1) Biological sex.--The term ``biological sex'' means the biological indication of male and female as determined by reproductive potential or capacity, such as sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, gonads, and nonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth, without regard to a person's psychological, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.(2) Designated violation.--The term ``designated violation'' means an actual or threatened violation of this section.(3) ESEA.--The terms ``elementary school'' and ``secondary school'' have the meanings given the terms in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).(4) Gender identity.--The term ``gender identity'' means a person's self-perception of their gender or claimed gender, regardless of the person's biological sex.(5) Gender transition.--(A) In general.--The term ``gender transition'' includes both medical transition and social transition.(B) Medical transition.--The term ``medical transition'' means any medical, hormonal, or surgical intervention undertaken to alter the body of a person in order to assert an identity incongruent with biological sex or undertaken to create or facilitate the development of physiological or anatomical characteristics that resemble a sex different from the person's biological sex.(C) Social transition.--The term ``social transition'' means any action taken to affirm a person's asserted ``gender identity'' that is in contradiction to the person's biological sex, including but not limited to decisions pertaining to the use of sex-specific facilities and accommodations, participation in sex-segregated sports or activities, pronoun and name usage, boarding, sleeping and travel arrangements for field trips (including overnight trips), and dress code guidelines.(6) Governmental entity.--The term ``governmental entity'' means a school district, a local educational agency, a school board, or any agency or other governmental unit or subdivision of a State responsible for education, or of such a local government.(7) Qualified party.--The term ``qualified party'' means--(A) the Attorney General of the United States; or(B) any parent or legal guardian adversely affected by the designated violation. &lt;all&gt;</pre></body></html>"b"Congressional Bills 117th CongressFrom the U.S. Government Publishing OfficeH.R. 2695 Introduced in House (IH)&lt;DOC&gt;117th CONGRESS1st SessionH.

Addressing violence against women and girls in humanitarian relief, peacekeeping, conflict, and postconflict settings.SEC. 2. FINDINGS.Congress makes the following findings:(1) An estimated one out of every three women throughout the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime.(2) Up to 70 percent of women in some countries report experiencing gender-based violence at some point in their lives.(3) Intimate partner violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, preventing them from playing more active roles in the social, economic, and political development of their communities.(4) Sexual violence among adolescents and pre-adolescents is alarmingly high. National surveys in Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Haiti have found that between 28 and 38 percent of girls and between 9 and 18 percent of boys report experiencing sexual violence before reaching 18 years of age.(5) Adult male respondents in six countries who had experienced violence as children were significantly more likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence themselves according to the International Men and Gender Equality Survey dataset. Analysis by the International Center for Research on Women further shows that men who witnessed violence against their mothers are consistently and significantly more likely to report perpetrating sexual violence. Further, sexually aggressive behaviors start young for these men, and overlap significantly with other forms of physical violence.(6) Gender-based violence harms economies and the workers that fuel them. Despite under-reporting, striking statistics document prevalent forms of gender-based violence globally that affect the world of work. Worldwide, women are concentrated in low-wage, insecure jobs in workplaces where they lack bargaining power, protections against gender-based violence, safe and confidential reporting systems, recourse to justice, and access to legal, medical, and psychosocial services.(7) Women living in poverty are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence. Lack of economic opportunities often compel women to use desperate and dangerous means to provide for themselves and their families, risking significant exposure to sexual exploitation and abuse. These women often cannot afford critical social and medical services.(8) Research conducted in India, Colombia, South Africa, and Uganda indicates that when women have greater control of assets, they are less likely to experience intimate partner violence. Additionally, when women participate in the economy, they are able to develop a wider support network, which allows them to more easily escape intimate partner violence.(9) Gender-based violence impacts livelihoods and food security by reducing work capacity and productivity, including the ability to grow food for consumption. Studies have shown that women affected by gender-based violence are exposed to illnesses and injuries that hamper their ability to work productively and care for their families. Diminished food production consequently increases hunger and women's vulnerability to further violence.(10) Country studies indicate that the risk of HIV among women who have experienced violence may be up to three times higher than among those who have not experienced violence. The World Health Organization found that women who experience intimate partner violence are at more than 50 percent greater risk of HIV infection, and in some instances their risk of HIV infection increases four-fold. Women living with HIV are more likely to experience violence than other women, and fear of violence can prevent women from accessing HIV/AIDS information and receiving treatment and counseling.(11) Addressing gender norms and inequities is essential to reducing HIV risk and increasing access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for women and men.(12) Prevalence of sexual and physical violence is higher among persons with disabilities, particularly for adolescents and intimate partners with disabilities, and for men and women with intellectual impairments living in institutions. The World Health Organization reports that rates of gender-based violence are between 4 and 10 times greater among persons with disabilities compared to non-disabled persons.(13) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural disasters face extreme violence and threats, including--(A) being forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian supplies; and(B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual exploitation, and abuse.(14) Rape and sexual assault against women and girls are used to torture, intimidate, and terrorize communities. Rape and sexual assault are used as tools of war in conflict zones, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, El Salvador, and South Sudan. UNFPA, the United Nation's reproductive health and rights agency, leads the Gender Based Violence Area of Responsibility, which is responsible for global coordination and collaboration on GBV prevention and response in humanitarian settings and is a leading provider of post-rape care and other reproductive health services and commodities in humanitarian settings.(15) Child and forced marriage of girls--(A) is a harmful practice that deprives girls of their dignity and rights and creates barriers to development for communities and countries;(B) is projected to affect more than 150,000,000 girls who will become brides between 2019 and 2030;(C) can prematurely end girls' education, increase vulnerability to gender-based violence, and significantly raise the risk of maternal and infant morbidity or mortality, including the risk of obstetric fistula and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS;(D) is perpetuated by poverty, a lack of educational or employment opportunities for girls, a lack of legal policies and enforcement of laws, and religious, cultural, and social factors related to girls' perceived lack of value, factors which become particularly acute in conflict and disaster settings where fears of sexual violence and overstretched coping mechanisms often drive child and forced marriage; and(E) child marriage is estimated to contribute, on average, to a loss in earnings of about nine percent for women who married early, which translates into a loss of about one percent in earnings for the entire labor force when factoring in all working adults.(16) Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is carried out most often on girls between infancy and 15 years of age and has impacted more than 200,000,000 girls and women who are alive today. FGM/C can cause long-term health problems, including infertility, complications in childbirth, and increased risk of newborn deaths. Mental health is one of the least explored domains of impact of gender-based violence; indeed, self-harm and suicide is the leading cause of death globally for adolescent girls aged 15-19.(17) World Bank data shows that gender inequality directly corresponds to increased levels of political and economic instability within states. Gender-based violence impedes women's meaningful participation in social, political, and economic spheres, which is essential to the stability and democratization of a country. Since women disproportionately experience gender-based violence during conflict and post-conflict reconstruction, they can play a pivotal role in preventing, mitigating, and resolving conflict, and countering extremism.(18) Gender-based violence is a contributing factor to human trafficking. Experts in the field have reported that women and girls who have experienced gender-based violence and live in societies that tolerate severe gender discrimination appear to be more vulnerable to being trafficked. Comprehensive efforts to reduce human trafficking must include efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence due to the intertwined relationship of the two crimes.(19) Health services are among the first places survivors of violence seek assistance. Health focused nongovernmental organizations and United Nations agencies like UNFPA, the Reproductive Health and Rights Agency, has critical opportunities to reach affected women and girls.(20) Gender-based violence also manifests online; gender-based cyberviolence is a growing concern, with women and girls disproportionately affected and targeted based on their appearance, activism and sexuality.(21) Taking meaningful action to address gender-based violence is an imperative acknowledgment of a woman's agency and personal right to leading a dignified life.(22) Addressing gender norms and inequities is essential to reducing HIV risk and increasing access to HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for women and men.SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.It is the policy of the United States--(1) to take effective action to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls around the world as a matter of basic human rights and to promote gender equality, economic growth, and improved public health;(2) to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls internationally into United States foreign policy and foreign assistance programs, including peace-building efforts and humanitarian relief and recovery;(3) to support and build local capacity in developing countries, including the capacity of governments at all levels and nongovernmental organizations, especially women-led organizations to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls;(4) to consult, cooperate, coordinate, and collaborate with a wide variety of nongovernmental partners with demonstrated experience in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls, including faith-based organizations and women-led organizations;(5) to employ a multisectoral approach to preventing and responding to violence against women and girls internationally, including activities in the economic, education, health, nutrition, legal, and judicial sectors;(6) to work at all levels, from the individual to the family, community, local, national, and international levels, to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls around the world;(7) to enhance training by United States personnel of professional foreign military and police forces and judicial officials, including specific and thorough instruction on preventing and responding to violence against women and girls around the world;(8) to engage men and boys as partners, as an essential element of making sustained reductions in violence against women and girls;(9) to include the prevention of child and forced marriage as an important part of United States Government efforts to prevent violence against girls and promote gender equality and global health;(10) to require that all United States contractors and grantees establish appropriate policies and take effective measures to prevent violence against women and girls and sexual exploitation and abuse within their workforce;(11) to exert sustained international leadership to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls, including in bilateral and multilateral fora; and(12) to implement the United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally.SEC. 4.
