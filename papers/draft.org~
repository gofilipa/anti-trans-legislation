** argument
This is an essay about a machine process, one that you are by now
familiar with, even if you don't know how it works on a technical
level. My goal is to illuminate this machine process by drawing an
analogy between it and human affects of fear and desire, specifically,
what fear implies about desire, in the phobia that the body has toward
its own desire.

The analogy between machines and bodies evokes a longstanding
conflation of the two in the term "Artificial Intelligence," which is
itself an anthropomorphization of machine processes like algorithmic
prediction.[fn:1] My intention is not to do away with this conflation,
but to re-orient some of the terms on which it rests. Information
processing is seen as intelligent, as human-like (it is
anthromoporphized) but with the benefit of being free of the human
body. So let us bring the body back into the machine. This paper
achieves this goal in two ways: by attending to embodied experience of
phobia, and what phobia reveals about desire, and by tracing the
materiality of machine learning processes.

To bring machines and bodies into relation, I enlist the concept of
normativity, and particularly, the attachment to normativity that, I
will show, brings procedures of both desire and of algorithmic
prediction into productive relation. I will take, on the one hand, the
desire for normative gender identities that underlies contemporary
discourses of transphobia, expressed in the anti-trans legislative
movement, and, on the other hand, what happens to data as it is used
to train machine learning models. Across these widely different
domains, I argue, this shared drive toward normativity enables me to
deploy machine learning as an apt tool for studying normativity in
transphobic language.

The investment in normativity is a through line, common ground,
between transphobia and trans affirmation. It is the answer to the
question--What do trans subjects and far right ideologues have in
common? In a more subtle way, it is also an attempt to bring desire
explicitly into computational processing.

** TODO close reading
First I will do a close-reading of the legislation and some of the
discourse surrounding the anti-trans movement. Here are some titles of
recent "anti-trans" legislation being currently debated in the US
Congress.

[SLIDE - FEDERAL BILL NAMES]

- US HB1064: Ensuring Military Readiness Act of 2023
  - disqualifies transgender persons from military service
- US HB1276: Protect Minors from Medical Malpractice Act of 2023
  - doctors to be liable to all adverse effects (physical,
    psychological, etc) following trans-affirming care
- US HB1399: Protect Children’s Innocence Act
  - gender-affirming care on minors to be a felony
- US HB216: My Child, My Choice Act of 2023
  - schools to obtain written parental consent before teaching
    anything related to gender/sex/sexuality.

Here, you'll see a list of the most recent bill titles being proposed
in Congress, like "Ensuring Military Readiness Act," and "Protect
Children's Innocence Act." The majority of these bills target
education, seeking to ban education on gender and sexuality, and
students' chosen names and pronouns, as well as healthcare, where many
bills outlaw gender-affirming care for minors and adults.

I'll come back to these bill titles in a moment, but for now, it's
enough to acknowledge that they are based on a certain logic that
gender nonconformity is a national threat, from which the American
people (in particular children) need protection.

This logic is driven by a particular fear of transness being
contagious, that it can spread from person to person. This fear, which
is popularized in the now debunked medical diagnosis called
"Rapid-onset Gender Dysphoria," or ROGD, has had a significant
influence on public perception around Trans issues, especially as they
affect minors.

SLIDE - SHRIER BOOK COVER

One notable example of this is a book by Abigail Shrier, called
"Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters."
Shrier's thesis is that minors, who do not know what they want, cannot
be trusted to make decisions about their gender.

Unlike the language of the legislative bills, Shrier's tone throughout
the book is highly ironic, an irony that embeds some interesting
subtexts.

SLIDE - SHRIER QUOTE

For example, there is a double meaning behind some of her
pronouncements. She says things like: "if the government can’t force
students to salute a flag, the government can’t force a healthcare
worker to utter a particular pronoun. In America, the government can’t
make people say things--not even for the sake of politeness. Not for
any reason at all" (xx).

Here, Shrier makes a comparison to patriotism---in the flag
salute---to make a point about governmental authority. The point is
that, just as the government cannot compel people to express loyalty
to the country's symbols, so it cannot compel respect (or here, she
refers to it as "politeness") for a person's preferred gender
designation.

Through this comparision to patriotism, and the framing of the issue
around expression, the subtext here seems to be that forcing pronoun
usage would be fascist. Which is a strange way to make a point to what
(I imagine) is a largely conservative readership.

Unless, reading this statement through the frame of irony, the point
is precisely that some kinds of expression should be free while others
should not. That we /do/ have the right to question each other's
genders, but we shouldn't question the flag.

In plain terms, then, the sentence would be saying something like,
"look, our government so loves your freedom, that it cannot even force
you to show respect for it." And, it follows, "if you are free to
disrespect such a government, then you surely cannot be obligated to
honor someone's pronouns".

In this reading, we can trace a direct line between an investment in
patriotism to an investment to gender norms.

While I enjoy doing this kind of analysis of irony, it is exactly the
kind of reading that I don't want to do for this project. Because the
more that I engage with the material and the public discourse around
it, the more I am convinced that this particular historical moment
needs another mode of reading.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]  The emergence of "Artifical Intelligence" can, in one
trajectory, be traced to Alan Turing's famous essay on the subject
(/Computing Machinery and Intelligence/. Although many people who cite
this origin fail to recognize the Turing made a crucial distinction
between actual intelligence, which is virtually impossible to detect
as experienced subjectively, and the performance of it, which he poses
as the criterion for assessing the quality of machine processing)
which inaugurates what N. Katherine Hayles calls a history of
"information los[ing] its body," as scientific discourses increasingly
overlook the role of the body and embodiment in machine "thinking."
This tendency is to conceptualize thinking or information processing
as separate from the substrate that enables such procedures, bringing
us to where we are today, when casual users of the now ubiquitous chat
interfaces (the contemporary "terminal" of Turing's experiment) find
themselves in thrall to a disembodied subjectivity (There is a
fascinating clash about the role of intention in interpreting machine
generated langauge between computational linguists like Emily Bender,
who assert that intention (specifically, the intuition of intention by
a reader) is necessary for interpretation and Literary Studies
scholars who maintain that intention can be and sometimes is severed
from communicative acts. See "Climbing towards NLU: On Meaning, Form,
and Understanding in the Age of Data", and /Critical Inquiry/'s June
2023 special issue, "Again Theory: A Forum on Language, Meaning, and
Intent in the Time of Stochastic Parrots.").
