- [ ] Bias is one dimensional
  - [ ] Equalized Odds[fn:11] measures how well models perform, how
    "accurate" they are, prompted by different identities.
    - Nemani et al 2023: "measures the degree to which a model’s
      predictions are equal across different demographic groups, such
      as males and female. In the context of gender bias, the metric
      can be used to assess whether the model is making equally
      accurate predictions for male and female inputs."
  - [ ] May et al 2019: They apply WEAT to sentence level tests, enabling
    them to explore complex kinds of intersectional bias (citing hooks
    and Crenshaw) and find the method unreliable perhaps due to
    difficulty in simplifying concepts/contexts in sentence-level
    inputs.
  - [ ] FISE procedure (Charlesworth et al 2024).
    - “Interestingly, the data show less support for class-centrism,
      i.e. rich does not dominate frequencies in language to the same
      extent that White supersede Black, or men supersede women. For
      example, *Black Poor* (6% of traits) and *Black Rich* (5% of
      traits) are similar in frequency showing that the low frequency
      of traits associated with *Black* is not altered even after
      including the dominant class group *Rich*. Perhaps class may be
      less of a marked category in language: we may be unlikely to
      point out that someone is *rich*, unless it is extreme wealth,
      because categorizing class is prone to subjective judgments of
      wealth cues ([31](javascript:;)). In contrast, race and gender
      may be relatively less ambiguous in categorizations and
      therefore more likely to be noted in language and to shape trait
      frequencies.” (Charlesworth et al 2024). 
      - makes assumptions about visibility and invisibilty of certain
	identities, like class, saying that it's not as prevalent
	because being "rich" or "poor" isn't as marked in language;
	whereas class vs race visibility has been well theorized in
	humanities.
