AL_SB211 INTRODUCED
- Studies have shown that the benefits that natural testosterone
  provides to biological male athletes is not significantly diminished
  through the use of testosterone suppression. Testosterone
  suppression in biological males does not result in a level playing
  field between biological male and biological female athletes.
- Because of the physical differences between biological males and
  biological females, having separate athletic teams based on the
  athletes' biological sex reduces the chance of injury to biological
  female athletes and promotes sex equality. It provides opportunities
  for biological female athletes to compete against their peers rather
  than against biological male athletes, and allows biological female
  athletes to compete on a fair playing field for scholarships and
  other athletic accomplishments.
- "gender identity" means an internal sense of being male, female, or
  something else, which may or may not correspond to an individual's
  sex assigned at birth or sex characteristics.

- maintaining fairness in athletic opportunities for women is an
  important state interest;
- requiring the designation of separate sex-specific athletic teams or
  sports is necessary to maintain fairness in athletic opportunities
  for women;
- significant biological and physiological differences between males
  and females, including greater strength, speed, and endurance
  capabilities among males on average, provide a competitive advantage
  to male athletes in sports; and
- It is the intent of the legislature to preserve an even playing
  field in school athletic programs, to maintain opportunities for
  female athletes to demonstrate their strength, skills, and athletic
  abilities, and to provide female athletes with opportunities to
  obtain recognition and accolades, college scholarships, and the
  numerous other long-term benefits that result from participating and
  competing in athletic endeavors.
